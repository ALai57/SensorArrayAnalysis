%%%% Mean firing rate vs.target force level.


%%%% Amplitude vs firing rate


%%%%%%%%%% GET STRUCT REPORTING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE FIELDS


%%% Quantile regression to see how MU amplitude quantiles change over
%%% force levels??

%%%% Median firing rate vs target force mixed model...
% Dependent variable - median firing rate.
% Independent variable = target force
% Random variable - slope for each subject, intercept for each subject

% Control - is effect of target force >0
% Stroke  - is effect of target force >0 - is effect of target force
% different on aff and contra?
