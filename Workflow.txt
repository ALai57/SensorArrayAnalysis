Steps in analysis:

FIRST, convert files to MAT format.
1) Convert .smr file to .mat file
	Open the script 'DataOrganization\Convert_Spike2_To_MAT.s2s' in Spike2.
	Run the script.
		- Select the .smr file you want to export
		- That's all! You will get a .mat file as an output when the file is done running

2) Convert .hpf files to .mat files
  2a) Convert .hpf files to .csv files using the Delsys File Conversion Utility
  2b) Convert CSV files to .mat files using 'DataOrganization\RUN_Convert_CSVfiles_To_MATLAB_Tables.m'


SECOND, manually edit files to eliminate any bad trials.
EG. If there are any "bad trials", trials in which a trigger was sent, but the trial is bad, you need to find these and eliminate them

1) Delete bad Sensor Array files 	
        1a) Delete the bad .hpf files from the .hpf directory.
        1b) Delete the bad .csv files from the 'array' directory
        1c) Delete the bad .mat files from the 'array' directory

2) Delete bad Single Differential Files
        2a) Open the .MAT file that was converted from the SMR file.
	2b) Manually edit the values in the variable 'Memory.values' (This variable has all the triggers sent to the Spike 2 program. You need to eliminate all the bad triggers)


THIRD, once only good trials are left, segment the Single Differential file into .mat trials
 
1) Run the file 'DataOrganization\RUN_Segment_SMRMAT_To_MATLAB_Tables.mat' to segment the big file into smaller ones.

2) Copy the segmented files into a new folder '\singlediff'
